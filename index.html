        <h1>A Little About Me</h1><hr>
        <h3>My Childhood</h3>
        <p>I was born in New York on march 8th, 2001. The hospital messed 
        up my name, it was supposed to be polish, Natalie without the "e"
        I'm half Polish and half Japanese, so the food is always great. 
        Shortly after my birth, I flew to Poland where I spent most of my 
        childhoood days running in the forest barefoot and building tree forts.
        In actual trees. The animals of the forest were my best friends,
        and the stars in the sky were always bright. I went with the neighborhood kids on
        grand adventures, and we played socccer in the meadows every day.
        I learned the language and it was a relatively not-busy life, I was
        always discovering brand new things.

        <h3>School Life</h3>
        <p>Like every other kid on the planet, I think school is dreadfully
        boring. I dont think I would've gone willingly if it weren't for my
        friends. There's way too much work and I've got no idea how I'll survive 
        the year. My favorite subjects are history and English and I hate matyh,
        like a lot. I went to study literature at Harvard this passed summer, 
        and I went to Europe as I do every summer. I ran out of museums to look at, 
        I'm pretty sure. Oh, and I think im going to persue a career in humanities.</p>

        <h3>Activities</h3>
       <p> I can pretty much play any sport, and im a great artist, I can draw
        anything, humans, animals, sceneric views, all of it. I can play some 
        instruments and i've been practicing vocal for a good five years. 
        Out of all the instruments, the one I like the least is the violin,
        it gives me so many back cramps. I like watching movies and reading on 
        rainy days witth hot coco. I used to ski every chance I go tin the winter
        but since both my knees are injured now because I attempted a crazy trick, 
        I cant do it anymore. Love to travel too!!</p>
